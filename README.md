Hydroponics Learning Simulator

This project is a simple, browser-based hydroponics simulator designed to help beginners understand how hydroponic systems work. It focuses on users in urban Pakistan, where water scarcity, rising temperatures, and shrinking agricultural land make small-scale home food production increasingly important.

The idea is to give people a safe place to learn the basics before investing in any hardware. The simulator shows how crops respond to changes in EC, pH, light, temperature, humidity, and water level, and guides the user with prompts and feedback so they understand why each parameter matters.
