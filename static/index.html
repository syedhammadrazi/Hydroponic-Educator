          Grow fresh food with far less water and space — right where people live. Hydroponics grows plants without soil by circulating nutrient-rich water directly to roots. Because the water is recirculated and precisely delivered, hydroponic systems can use <em>up to ~90% less water</em> than conventional soil farming.

          <h2>Why Pakistan needs hydroponics?</h2>

          <!-- “Why it matters for Pakistan” from snippet -->
          <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Severe water stress:</strong> Pakistan’s per-capita water availability fell from &gt;5,000 m³ (1951)
              to &lt;1,000 m³ (2005) and is projected to drop <em>below 500 m³</em> (absolute scarcity). The water storage facilities are limited
              (~159 m³ per person and ~10% of annual flow vs ~40% global average).</li>
            <li><strong>Urban water access is declining:</strong> piped water access in cities fell from 62% (2006–2007) to ~36% (2019–220),
              pushing households toward unsafe or informal sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanishing urban farmland:</strong> Lahore continues to lose agricultural land to housing; in Karachi,
              cultivated area shrank from ~90,078 acres (1972) to ~37,887 acres (2010) while urban area expanded 286→820 km² —
              weakening local fresh-food supply.</li>
            <li><strong>Hotter, more polluted cities:</strong> urban heat-island effects raised land-surface temps by ~3.7°C
              in Lahore (2000–2020) and ~3.9°C in Karachi over 10 years; indoor controlled production is more resilient.</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- Card 2 -->
        <article class="card">
          <h2>How can hydroponics help?</h2>
          <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Water-smart:</strong> closed-loop delivery can cut water use by up to ~90% vs soil farming.</li>
            <li><strong>Space-efficient:</strong> works on rooftops, balconies, and indoors; vertical stacks multiply yield per m².</li>
            <li><strong>Local & resilient:</strong> replaces some food lost to urbanization; controlled environments beat heat/smog disruptions.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <!-- Card 3 -->
        <article class="card">
          <h2>People are willing — they just need guidance</h2>
          <p>
            Recent research in Lahore shows <em>high willingness</em> to adopt urban agriculture, but low practice due to
            lack of training, limited land/time, and finances — pointing to the need for accessible education tools and
            hands-on guidance.
