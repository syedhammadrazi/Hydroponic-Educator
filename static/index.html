        <h1>Hydroponics for Urban Pakistan</h1>
        <p class="tagline">
          Grow fresh food with far less water and space — right where people live.
          Hydroponics grows plants without soil by circulating nutrient-rich water
          directly to roots. Because the water is recirculated and precisely
          delivered, hydroponic systems can use
          <em>up to ~90% less water</em> than conventional soil farming.

          <h2>Why Pakistan needs hydroponics</h2>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              <strong>Severe water stress:</strong>
              Pakistan’s per-capita water availability fell from &gt;5,000 m³ (1951)
              to &lt;1,000 m³ (2005) and is projected to drop
              <em>below 500 m³</em> (absolute scarcity). Storage is limited
              (~159 m³ per person and ~10% of annual flow vs ~40% global average).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Urban water access is declining:</strong>
              piped water access in cities fell from 62% (2006–2007) to ~36% (2019–20),
              pushing households toward unsafe or informal sources.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vanishing urban farmland:</strong>
              Lahore continues to lose agricultural land to housing; in Karachi,
              cultivated area shrank from ~90,078 acres (1972) to ~37,887 acres (2010)
              while urban area expanded from 286 to 820 km², weakening local fresh-food supply.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hotter, more polluted cities:</strong>
              urban heat-island effects raised land-surface temperatures by ~3.7°C
              in Lahore (2000–2020) and ~3.9°C in Karachi over 10 years; indoor
              controlled production is more resilient.

          <h2>How hydroponics helps</h2>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              <strong>Water-smart:</strong>
              closed-loop delivery can cut water use by up to ~90% compared with soil farming.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Space-efficient:</strong>
              works on rooftops, balconies, and indoors; vertical stacks increase yield per m².
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Local and resilient:</strong>
              recovers some food lost to urbanisation, and controlled environments
              are less affected by heat and smog.
            </li>

          <h2>People are willing — they just need guidance</h2>
          <p>
            Recent research in Lahore shows <em>high willingness</em> to adopt urban
            agriculture, but low practice due to lack of training, limited land and time,
            and financial constraints. This points to a need for practical education
            tools and step-by-step support.
